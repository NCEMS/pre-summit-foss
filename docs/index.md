# Welcome to NCEMS Pre Summit Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) Training!

![header](assets/foss_title.png)

## Workshop Summary

[NCEMS](https://ncems.psu.edu){target=_blank} presents Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS) as a roadmap to guide your computational research and level up your teaching, collaboration, proposal writing, and publishing. 

FOSS offers a hands-on learning resource to build a solid Open Science foundation for your research and educational projects in a supportive atmosphere with peers and project mentors. 

The workshop focuses on introducing you to a host of software tools to help manage your data and make your science open, reproducible, and scaleable. Please see the [Schedule](./schedule.md) for the list of lessons and content covered throughout the workshop. 


## Workshop Structure

Synchronously, we will meet each week virtually for 1.5 hours to discuss and have hands-on activities with our instructors. The [workshop content](./01_intro_open_sci.md) is always available for you to read through to develop your own project-based ideas for strengthening your Open Science skills. 

Much of the content interconnects from week to week and many of the skills and approaches we discuss relate to each other. However, students should be able to derive significant value from attending single sessions. 

Our ultimate goal in this workshop is for you to "level up" one or more of those philosophies/approaches/skills.

## Expected Outcomes

-   Proficiently organize your lab, external and internal communications, and teach and conduct research with open source software
-   Ability to scale out computations from laptop to the cloud and High Performance Computing/High Throughput Computing systems
-   Skillfully manage your research data through the data lifecycle 
-   Join a larger community of Open Science practitioners
-   Be an Advocate for Open Science in your professional circles and communities

By working through an example project relevant to your interests, you will practice open science skills using CyVerse, GitHub, R or Python, and other resources. At the end of the course, you and your team will present a plan for how to integrate open science into your research, lab, or other areas of your choosing.
