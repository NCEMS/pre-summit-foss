## Calendar

| Week | Date | Content | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Sept. 4 |  [Intro to Open Science](01_intro_open_sci.md) <br> <br> [Session Recording](https://youtu.be/hkRzC6LttIQ) | In the opening session we take in the big picture of what Open Science is and why. We will discuss how an open approach can be applied to scientific research. This is our least technical session.  |
| **Week 2** | Sept. 11 | [Data management](02_managing_data.md) <br> <br> [Session Recording](https://youtu.be/9v6OHx5QxUc) | The foundation of any science endeavor is data. In this session we will dive deep into storing, sharing, and managing your datasets. We'll specifically cover data management plans (DMPs) and explain how licenses can allow other researchers to build on your work while ensuring credit is given. |
| **Week 3** | Sept. 18 | [Project Management](03_project_management.md) | Managing a productive, modern, digitally native, research group requires planning, governance, clear communication, and ethical codes of conduct. |
| **Week 4** | Sept. 25| [How to Talk to Computers](04_talk_to_computer.md) | Behind the veil of graphical point-and-click computing lies the command line, a more direct and powerful way to instruct your computer. In this session we will introduce you to the basics of the Unix command line (aka shell). This skill is not only useful for your personal computer, but also a necessity for cloud and HPC. We will also touch on LLM chatbots because they are changing the game of scientific computing very rapidly. |
